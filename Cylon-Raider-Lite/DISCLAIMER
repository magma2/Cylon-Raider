DISCLAIMER:

This python app should ONLY be used with...
1. A VM installation of Kali Linux
or...
2. A persistent USB installation of Kali Linux

Due to conflicts between Mana-Toolkit/DNSMasq and Gnome-Network-Manager...
Attempting a setup to get Mana working on a permanent install of Kali Linux may break your install!

Specifically, the networking settings.

Therefore it is highly recommended that you use this on a disposable copy of Kali instead!

To install into your Kali distro of choice, just drag and drop the entire folder into /root directory
Then run the required setups
