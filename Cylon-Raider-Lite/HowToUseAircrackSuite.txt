3. Locate a BSSID of your target and then run targetedMode.sh
4. In targetedMode.sh enter the BSSID MAC of target to only capture packets of that device
5. Open a new terminal and run replayAttack.sh, enter BSSID MAC + # of deauth packets you want to send
6. If you are successful with capturing the 4-way handshake, the terminal running targetedMode.sh will say WPA-Handshake on the top-right
7. You should LEAVE the area as soon as you capture the 4-way handshake. 
8. Cracking the handshake could be done at home
