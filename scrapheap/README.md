This is just a description for the "scrapheap", which is discarded code from my various project.s Likely as a result of dealing with
terrible advice on the internet or lack of information.

You can play around with this as you wish. I only put it here because it would obstruct my progress to leave it around elsewhere (like never reuse code from a failed project)
